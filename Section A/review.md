## Aspects that could be improved

  

Overall this is a good submission. But there are a few changes that need to be made, as well as a few improvements that will help in future.

  

* Changes that need to be made

	* On line 23, you call a function called "reverseString", based on your previous code this should be "reverse_string"

	* The function that generates the Fibonacci sequence is never used

* Things to avoid in the future

* Some of your varibales are hard coded where it would be better to ask a user for input
